simple functions explained. To select an option, simply enter 0 or 1 to access one of the methods to set your currencies, or 2 to 
set the amount you wish to convert. With 0 you will set the currency that you want the money exchanged from, 1 will set to currency 
it will be exchanged to. If you enter a currency with some further selection possibilities, it will show you a list of those currencies 
with an index number by what you might choose a specific currency. If you enter a wrong input, you will have to restart the process 
from the main menu.
